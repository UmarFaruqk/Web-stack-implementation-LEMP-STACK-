## MY SELF STUDY ON LEMP STACK
1. Overview of Linux Shell Commands 
Moving and Copying files (mv  cp)
create empty file and update timestamp (touch)
change or modify file permissions (chmod)
get count lines,words and character in file (wc)
return line in files matching platform
list files and directiry (ls)
find files in directory tree (find)
get present working directory (pwd)
make directory (mkdir)
change direectory (cd)
remove directory (rmdir)
2. Got Familiar with With text editors like Vi, Vim and Nano 
   I realized that Vi and Vim use almost same Syntax when it comes to inserting or saving and exiting the interface. I now also the know the linux  commands used to view files in text editors (cat, more,head,tail and wc)
3. I got familiar with basic sql syntax and most commonly used command like: 
   i- SELECT: statement used to specify which columns of a databse table should be included in the results
   ii- SELECT *: Used to select all the colums from a table 
   iii- LIMIT: Limiting the number of rows returned from a table is a useful trick for speeding query time
   iv- AS:To rename a column or a table when returning results, you can use the AS command to set an alias for your outputs
   v- SELECT DISTINCT: Datasets often contain duplicate rows or values in a column. Combining SELECT with DISTINCT drops duplicates
   Vi- COUNT: COUNT() returns the number of rows in the table or group
